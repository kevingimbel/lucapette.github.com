Two years ago I had the opportunity to shift my career toward product
management. It took me a while to accept the job, it was no easy decision.
I needed to be ready for leading a team of people doing a job I never did
before. While I felt ready on the leadership part, I was afraid of not being
able to get up to speed fast enough with the product part.

Almost two years passed and I learned a lot. On the way, I made a few crucial
mistakes. Making mistakes is part of the game but I want to focus my attention
toward those four or five things that I consider central to product
management. I consider the learnings I'm about to share literally "common
sense" and if I find myself summarising this experience with a joke:

> Common sense is not so common

This is the reason why I feel compelled to share mistakes I consider basic
product management now. Furthermore, writing helps me clearing my own thoughts
about things. It is a discovery process and the best part is that someone else
may even find it useful. Well, please let me know about that.

I will present my list in no particular order. All I learned in the past two
years revealed to be important to me.

## Data is nothing. Information is key

Recently, we introduced [blazer](https://github.com/ankane/blazer) at work,
a little tool I wanted to add it to our portfolio of internal applications for
a long time. The reaction from other departments' folk was great. Everyone was
happy about the tool and it was a stimulating process for me. I started asking
myself what it is the real difference between a product development team
providing data for the rest of the company and everyone being able to ask
questions on their own. My assumption was that people were happy about
shortening the feedback loop. It's like writing tests instead of deploying
code. It takes less time to figure out you broke something with a change if
there are tests around. But I was wrong. My technical background made me focus
on the wrong aspect of this problem. Everyone wants answers faster, no
discussion there. I kept asking myself why as the short lead time could not
explain the enthusiasm. I started interviewing the people I worked with in
other departments. One day I came to realise data is nothing. No one really
cares about the conversation rate comparison about two countries. They want to
know *why* is different. The underlining information is the key. People can do
a better job when they can extract knowledge out of data. Knowing why
a company performs better in a market is key info. Finding the answer will
improve your marketing strategy and this kind of initiative can change the
story of a company dramatically.

Working with product managers and senior management meant being in
conversations where all you would hear is data. It took me a while to realise
I was confusing data for information. I had no process in place to make that
transformation happening. I needed to figure out we needed a systematic
approach to the transformation process. At the end of the day, it's a simple
process:

> When presented data, ask yourself why is that?

Ask questions all the time. You hear data points and you automatically ask
yourself why is that. What is the explanation behind it. You need to transform
all the data points you hear into information. I believe this should be the
process backing up your roadmap. It's a three steps process:

1. Look at data
2. Ask yourself why
3. Extract information

And I think it should be a big chuck of the product discovery phase. Most of
the time the answer to the question "what's next?" is already there, well
hidden in your data points. You don't know the answer because you're not
systematically asking yourself why.

Now, I'm thinking a lot about how to craft a small process around these steps
we have just discussed. Probably, that is a good topic for another article.
I did not have to chance to design a process and test it yet.

## Say no to CEO features

I define as "CEO features" those a product team builds because someone says so
or just because it sounded cool building them. By definition, those features
do not need to come from the CEO. The key mistake is fast tracking them
without the necessary scrutiny (here you need a "definition of ready",
something I should have done better too). It was very tricky for me to figure
how to handle those coming from the CEO. Here is the problem:

- My CEO sets up the vision of the company
- My job was execute that vision translating it into a product vision
- My team and I translated that vision into a product roadmap
- We build things from the roadmap

The problem lies in the tiny border between vision and roadmap. I think they
need to overlap, they must compliment each other. And that's exactly why this
has been so tricky for me. I struggled a lot with the concept as I could
correlate with my CEO saying "we should do this because it's the right thing".
It happened to me often enough while leading developers to struggle between
giving them enough room for decision and needing to do what I believed was the
right thing. So how do I say no to a "CEO feature" and keeping the overlap
between his vision and the product vision?

This was hard for me and, as most hard things, it had a very simple solution.
There isn't the word feature in the sentence "translating the vision into
a product roadmap". It's about the vision and its implementation as a roadmap.
And I did not get a roadmap isn't a set of features. A crucial mistake
I believe only a newcomer like me could make. The roadmap is a visualisation
of your strategy, a high level concept. Nothing about the CEO vision and the
product roadmap is about the features you build and it took me a while to
truly understand it.

Once again, it is just common sense. _Of course_ you should not let your "CEO
features" be fast tracked. _Of course_ it makes no sense to fast track any
feature. Now I think I have a good understanding of the relationship between
the CEO and the product team and I can back up my "No, we won't be doing that"
with good reasoning. It's not about a list of features, it's about clear
strategy and its execution.

## Say no with reason

[Saying no](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=saying+no+product+managment&ia=web)
seems to be a required feature for good product management. I can agree to
that sentiment but I think it's an incomplete statement. When I started
running my first product team we did not have enough people and experience to
say no. I struggled with it as I felt a bit alone doing that. It had bad
consequences:

- Irrelevant features were creeping into our building cycle
- We would often build the wrong thing and only realise after roll-out
- We would build more than we needed

It was not the nicest situation and it was that rare case in which hiring was
the answer (hint: use hiring as a last resource solution, it brings the best
out of you and the people around you). We hired more people and brought it the
necessary skills. Finally my team was saying no to feature requests. Oh it
felt good, I was not alone any more. But it had consequences for the rest of
the company. People were frustrated with the new attitude. I did expect it but
I still got something wrong. I thought it was a temporary phenomenon. I was
telling myself we just needed some time to adapt and people would understand
why saying no to most requests was the right thing to do for everyone. Here we
go, it's just common sense again: Why would people understand a no without
context?

We were only saying no, we were not explaining what was the benefit of saying
no. It turns out this issue is easy to fix: You say no to people and always
give them context about what you are going to do *instead* of what they
requested. It's as easy as that. Now, this comes with benefits that go from
your product team to the company and the other way around:

- The rest of the company understands better how you prioritize product work.
  It's vital for them to get it.
- You have to convince people that your prioritisation is the right one. Great
  side-effects:
  - You learn how to express things clearly and in plain English. No jargon,
    no acronyms. It makes your communication more inclusive.
  - You can catch errors in your own prioritisation. They may be right and
    that is a great outcome.

Figuring this out made me immediately a better professional.

## Do not ship what you can't measure

I must confess I felt guilty while reading about [feature
factories](https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory-44a5b938d6a2#.wkyer1gmt).
We showed clear signs when it came about impact analysis. What I did wrong
here is realising way too late how important it is to design a process around
impact. It felt especially bad to realise I was doing it wrong because I find
obvious there's value in doing impact analysis of features.

Now, I think I would be able to design a process around impact analysis but
I did not test it yet. I think it would be as easy as:

- Require all the features specs to provide an expected impact.
- Set up a recurrent meeting for evaluating expected versus reality with the
  product team.
- Share this twice: with the development teams and with the rest of the
  company.

I consider this a good start and I would love to evaluate the process itself
during retrospectives. I would be curious to hear other folks opinion on the
subject as my approach is still just a theory. And that needs testing and
feedback. I'm used to say "In theory, there's no difference between theory and
practise, in practise there is always a difference".

## Get rid of features no one uses

Deprecating features so you can simplify your product is important, simpler is
better. I think it is strictly connected to the previous point about impact
analysis. We did not do this enough because we did not know much about some of
the features. This way we kept growing our product in terms of complexity and
missed some opportunities to make our life easier and, above all, the
experience of out customers.

Given my background as developer, I found myself thinking about this problem
as refactoring code. It helped me realise I can approach decommissioning of
features the same way I approach a code base. My approach to refactoring is
you should not be doing it. It's more a catchy title for another article but
I think it conveys my message. My idea is you should be improving your code
base with every single change you make to it. Up to a point you won't need any
set of changes (developers tend to call it "pull requests" these days)
consisting of changes that only improve the code but have no other effects.
Applying this approach to product management can translate loosely into
"simplify your product with every features". Give more to your customers by
having *only* the features they *really* use.
