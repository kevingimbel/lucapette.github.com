  <h1 class="blog-title">Hello, people!</h1>
  <p class="lead blog-description">My name is Luca Pette and this is my
  personal website.
</div>

<article>
  <p>I use this website to publish my writings. I dare to think they interest
  you. As I write about different topics, the <a
    href="/articles.html">articles</a> page presents my writing by category.
  </p>
  <p>
  You can subscribe to my <a href="https://tinyletter.com/lucapette">newsletter</a>, I will
  send you an email every time I publish a new article.
  Recently, I wrote:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/my-journey-with-react-and-its-ecosystem-first-steps-with-webpack-babel-and-yarn">
      My journey with React and its ecosystem: First steps with webpack,
      babel, and yarn
    </a></li>
    <li><a href="/all-i-have-done-wrong-running-a-product-team">All I have
      done wrong running a product team</a></li>
    <li><a href="/a-few-words-about-hiring">A few words about hiring</a></li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>The <a href="/archive.html">archive</a> page contains the list of all the
  articles I have ever published on this website. Some of my writing is old
  enough I probably disagree with my old self now. I think that's a good
  sign.</p>

  <p> Feel free to get in touch! <a href=mailto:lucapette@gmail.com>Email</a>
  is best.</p>
